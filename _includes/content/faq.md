Is there a specific application for NuPIC?
--------------------
The algorithm lends itself well to high-speed temporal data, but it could potentially be applied to many different fields and endeavors.


What's the different between your contributor license and Apache's?
--------------------
Not much, really. Here's a [diff](http://www.diffchecker.com/tas54ez4).


What's the difference between this and your old offering?
--------------------
It is important to emphasize that the old and new NuPIC algorithms are completely different.  This isn't an enhancement.  It might be a bit confusing that we are using the same name but we figured only a few people would be aware of the old NuPIC offering. The main differences are: a) NuPIC today includes the CLA whereas the old NuPIC had our previous algorithms, b) old NuPIC was tuned for vision whereas new NuPIC is tuned for [Grok](http://groksolutions.com/product.html), and c) old NuPIC ran on Windows.
