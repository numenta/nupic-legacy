### Schedule

* * *

#### Saturday November 2

- **10:00 AM**: Kickoff with Jeff Hawkins
- **10:15 AM**: NuPIC Introduction
- **10:30 AM**: NuPIC Natural Language Processing Primer
- **11:00 AM**: HACK START
- **02:00 PM**: [CLA Deep Dive](#cla_deep_dive) (Subutai Ahmad)
- **04:00 PM**: [Working Session: NuPIC Documentation for ML/AI Researchers](#working_session_nupic_documentation_for_mlai_researchers) (Ian Danforth)

##### CLA Deep Dive

> Subutai Ahmad, Grok/Numenta VP of Engineering, will go into detail about some of the major components of the CLA, including the Spatial and Temporal Poolers. This talk will describe the theory behind these ideas (and others) as well as pointing out the locations within the NuPIC codebase where they are implemented. If you are interested in how the CLA within NuPIC works behind the curtains, this is the talk for you.

##### Working Session: NuPIC Documentation for ML/AI Researchers

> Descriptions matter. We'll be creating a document that describes NuPIC and CLA in terms that are familiar to academic Machine Learning and AI researchers. This document will become an entry point for academics into NuPIC. As we walk through CLA, participants will be asked to contribute how their field would describe each component, and suggest relevant citations for similar work. Components and performance characteristics of CLA which are particularly novel will be highlighted.

#### Sunday November 3
- **01:00PM**: [Sensor-Motor Integration in the Neocortex](#sensormotor_integration_in_the_neocortex) (Jeff Hawkins)
- **05:45PM**: HACK STOP
- **06:00PM**: Demonstrations

##### Sensor-Motor Integration in the Neocortex

> Most of the changes on our senses are due, wholly or in part, to our own actions.  Therefore, the neocortex learns a sensory-motor model of the world.  In this talk I discuss some of what we know about how the neocortex generates behavior and how we might construct a simple sensory-motor system based on the Cortical Learning Algorithm.  It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to add motor output to the CLA.  I will assume basic understanding of the CLA.

### Preparations
I recommend you get a [github](http://github.com) account if you don't already have one. Then you can get the code by simply running `git clone https://github.com/numenta/nupic.git` in a command-line interpreter. You can [download the code directly](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/archive/master.zip) if you don't want to use git. Depending on your OS and environment, you may have difficulties building NuPIC. Please make an attempt to build, run tests, and run the sample application as specified in the [README](https://github.com/numenta/nupic#numenta-platform-for-intelligent-computing-nupic). If you're still having trouble when you arrive, we'll help you get set up.

#### Virtual Machine
If nothing else works (or you are using Windows), we have a Virtual Machine instance set up for [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/). You'll need to follow [these instructions](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Running-Nupic-in-a-Virtual-Machine) to get it set up (the VM file is a 635MB download, so you might want to start now if you have a lame internet connection).

### Communication
Please read through our [community page](http://numenta.org/community.html) to get details about the mailing list and IRC channel. We'll be using them extensively to communicate during the hackathon. A lot of chatter will be happening on IRC, and you'll miss out if you don't take part. If you've never used IRC before, here are some nice IRC clients that make is easy to connect. Just install one of them, and [click here to join the #nupic room](irc://irc.freenode.net/nupic).

#### IRC Clients
- Mac OS X: [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/)
- Windows: [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/)
- Linux: [XChat](http://xchat.org/)
- Any OS: [Firefox Chatzilla Add-On](http://chatzilla.hacksrus.com/)

#### Streaming Video
Lots of people are interested in participating remotely. We're going to have at least one web camera set up in the main work area of the Tagged offices, so it is probable that audio and video of you will be broadcast on the internet during the hackathon. So be sure to brush your hair and look your best ;).

All presentation will be live-streamed as well, and preserved on YouTube for future viewers.
