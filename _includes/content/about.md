<div style="float:left;padding-right:14px"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/team.jpg"/></div>

Numenta, Inc. was formed in 2005 to develop biologically-inspired machine intelligence technology for both commercial and scientific use. To achieve this goal we are fully documenting our progress and discoveries. We also publish our software in a form that other people can use for both research and commercial development. We have structured our software to encourage the emergence of an independent, application developer community. Use of Numenta’s software and intellectual property is free for research purposes. We will generate revenue by selling support, licensing software, and licensing intellectual property for commercial deployments. We always will seek to make our developer partners successful, as well as be successful ourselves.

Numenta is based in Redwood City, California. It is privately funded.
