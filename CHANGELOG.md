## 0.2.0

* Code changes required for a Windows build.
* Updates nupic.core to d233c58b64e8064d4d12684634dc5e5e78c7ce0b.
* Implements capnp serialization for Python spatial pooler. Also implements temporary hack for putting .capnp files into the source tree since the build seems to be set up to install in-tree.

## 0.1.3

* Remove unnecessary build flag and fix a bug that was causing duplicated definition names.
* Added warning in README for OS X.
* Doc updates
* Include additional libs in common libs
* Use gcc in default docker configuration to match nupic.core binary release. Increase resources in coreos configuration.
* Fixed ValueError When coordinate encoder is used with DateEncoder
* Add library path for capnp libraries to linker.
* Adds capnp libraries to linker args.
* Adds interface file for converting from pycapnp schema to compiled in schema and uses it with SWIGed C++ SpatialPooler class's read and write methods.
* Discard NTA_PLATFORM_* in favor of NTA_OS_* and NTA_ARCH_* macro variables
* Raises exception when enableInference was not called, or when predicted field missing from input row.

## 0.1.2

* Add archflags env var before deploy command on OSX

## 0.1.1

* Removal of CMakeLists.txt
* Removes fake C extension from setup.
* Adds warning on darwin platform when ARCHFLAGS not set.
* Cleanup re: #1579.  Fixup namespace conflicts with builtins (file, dir, etc.) as well as minor alignment issues
* Switch from cmake to distutils extensions for nupic installation

## 0.1.0
