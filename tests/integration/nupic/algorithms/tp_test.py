This file performs a variety of tests on the reference temporal pooler code.

basic_test
==========

Tests creation and serialization of the TP class. Sets parameters and ensures
they are the same after a serialization and de-serialization step. Runs learning
and inference on a small number of random patterns and ensures it doesn't crash.

===============================================================================
                Basic First Order Sequences
===============================================================================

These tests ensure the most basic (first order) sequence learning mechanism is
working.

Parameters: Use a "fast learning mode": turn off global decay, temporal pooling
and hilo (make minThreshold really high). initPerm should be greater than
connectedPerm and permanenceDec should be zero. With these settings sequences
should be learned in one pass:

  minThreshold = newSynapseCount
  globalDecay = 0
  temporalPooling = False
  initialPerm = 0.8
  connectedPerm = 0.7
  permanenceDec = 0
  permanenceInc = 0.4

Other Parameters:
  numCols = 100
  cellsPerCol = 1
  newSynapseCount=11
  activationThreshold = 8
  permanenceMax = 1

Note: this is not a high order sequence, so one cell per column is fine.


Input Sequence: We train with M input sequences, each consisting of N random
patterns. Each pattern consists of a random number of bits on. The number of 1's
in each pattern should be between 21 and 25 columns. The sequences are
constructed so that consecutive patterns within a sequence don't share any
columns.

Training: The TP is trained with P passes of the M sequences. There
should be a reset between sequences. The total number of iterations during
training is P*N*M.

Testing: Run inference through the same set of sequences, with a reset before
each sequence. For each sequence the system should accurately predict the
pattern at the next time step up to and including the N-1'st pattern. A perfect
prediction consists of getting every column correct in the prediction, with no
extra columns. We report the number of columns that are incorrect and report a
failure if more than 2 columns are incorrectly predicted.

We can also calculate the number of segments and synapses that should be
learned. We raise an error if too many or too few were learned.

B1) Basic sequence learner.  M=1, N=100, P=1.

B2) Same as above, except P=2. Test that permanences go up and that no
additional synapses or segments are learned.

B3) N=300, M=1, P=1.  (See how high we can go with M)

B4) N=100, M=3, P=1   (See how high we can go with N*M)

B5) Like B1) but only have newSynapseCount columns ON in each pattern (instead of
between 21 and 25), and set activationThreshold to newSynapseCount.

B6) Like B1 but with cellsPerCol = 4. First order sequences should still work
just fine.

B7) Like B1 but with slower learning. Set the following parameters differently:

    activationThreshold = newSynapseCount
    minThreshold = activationThreshold
    initialPerm = 0.2
    connectedPerm = 0.7
    permanenceInc = 0.2

Now we train the TP with the B1 sequence 4 times (P=4). This will increment
the permanences to be above 0.8 and at that point the inference will be correct.
This test will ensure the basic match function and segment activation rules are
working correctly.

B8) Like B7 but with 4 cells per column. Should still work.

B9) Like B7 but present the sequence less than 4 times: the inference should be
incorrect.

B10) Like B2, except that cells per column = 4. Should still add zero additional
synapses.


===============================================================================
                High Order Sequences
===============================================================================

These tests ensure that high order sequences can be learned in a multiple cells
per column instantiation.

Parameters: Same as Basic First Order Tests above, but with varying cells per
column.

Input Sequence: We train with M input sequences, each consisting of N random
patterns. Each pattern consists of a random number of bits on. The number of 1's
in each pattern should be between 21 and 25 columns (except for H0). The
sequences are constructed so that consecutive patterns within a sequence don't
share any columns. The sequences are constructed to contain shared subsequences,
such as:

A B C D E F G H I J
K L M D E F N O P Q

The position and length of shared subsequences are parameters in the tests.

Training: Identical to basic first order tests above.

Testing: Identical to basic first order tests above unless noted.

We can also calculate the number of segments and synapses that should be
learned. We raise an error if too many or too few were learned.

H0) Two simple high order sequences, each of length 7, with a shared
subsequence in positions 2-4.  Each pattern has a consecutive set of 5 bits on.
No pattern shares any columns with the others. These sequences are easy to
visualize and is very useful for debugging.

H1) Learn two sequences with a short shared pattern. Parameters
should be the same as B1. This test will FAIL since cellsPerCol == 1. No
consecutive patterns share any column.

H2) As above but with cellsPerCol == 4. This test should PASS. No consecutive
patterns share any column.

H2a) Same as above, except P=2. Test that permanences go up and that no
additional synapses or segments are learned.

H3) Same parameters as H.2 except sequences are created such that they share a
single significant sub-sequence. Subsequences should be reasonably long and in
the middle of sequences. No consecutive patterns share any column.

H4) Like H.3, except the shared subsequence is in the beginning. (e.g.
"ABCDEF" and "ABCGHIJ". At the point where the shared subsequence ends, all
possible next patterns should be predicted. As soon as you see the first unique
pattern, the predictions should collapse to be a perfect prediction.

H5) Shared patterns. Similar to H3 except that patterns are shared between
sequences.  All sequences are different shufflings of the same set of N
patterns (there is no shared subsequence). Care should be taken such that the
same three patterns never follow one another in two sequences.

H6) Combination of H5) and H3). Shared patterns in different sequences, with a
shared subsequence.

H7) Stress test: every other pattern is shared. [Unimplemented]

H8) Start predicting in the middle of a sequence. [Unimplemented]

H9) Hub capacity. How many patterns can use that hub?
[Implemented, but does not run by default.]

H10) Sensitivity to small amounts of noise during inference. [Unimplemented]

H11) Higher order patterns with alternating elements.

Create the following 4 sequences:

     A B A B A C
     A B A B D E
     A B F G H I
     A J K L M N

After training we should verify that the expected transitions are in the
model. Prediction accuracy should be perfect. In addition, during inference,
after the first element is presented, the columns should not burst any more.
Need to verify, for the first sequence, that the high order representation
when presented with the second A and B is different from the representation
in the first presentation.


===============================================================================
                Temporal Pooling Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
===============================================================================

Parameters: Use a "fast learning mode": With these settings sequences should be
learned in one pass:

  minThreshold = newSynapseCount
  globalDecay = 0
  initialPerm = 0.8
  connectedPerm = 0.7
  permanenceDec = 0
  permanenceInc = 0.4

Other Parameters:
  cellsPerCol = 4
  newSynapseCount=11
  activationThreshold = 11
  permanenceMax = 1
  doPooling = True

Input Sequence: We train with M input sequences, each consisting of N random
patterns. Each pattern consists of a random number of bits on. The number of 1's
in each pattern should be between 17 and 21 columns. The sequences are
constructed so that consecutive patterns within a sequence don't share any
columns.

Note: for pooling tests the density of input patterns should be pretty low
since each pooling step increases the output density. At the same time, we need
enough bits on in the input for the temporal pooler to find enough synapses. So,
for the tests, constraints should be something like:

(Input Density) * (Number of pooling steps) < 25 %.
          AND
sum(Input) > newSynapseCount*1.5

Training: The TP is trained with P passes of the M sequences. There
should be a reset between sequences. The total number of iterations during
training is P*N*M.

Testing: Run inference through the same set of sequences, with a reset before
each sequence. For each sequence the system should accurately predict the
pattern at the next P time steps, up to and including the N-P'th pattern. A
perfect prediction consists of getting every column correct in the prediction,
with no extra columns. We report the number of columns that are incorrect and
report a failure if more than 2 columns are incorrectly predicted.

P1) Train the TP two times (P=2) on a single long sequence consisting of random
patterns (N=20, M=1). There should be no overlapping columns between successive
patterns. During inference, the TP should be able reliably predict the pattern
two time steps in advance. numCols should be about 350 to meet the above
constraints and also to maintain consistency with test P2.

P2) Increase TP rate to 3 time steps in advance (P=3). At each step during
inference, the TP should be able to reliably predict the pattern coming up at
t+1, t+2, and t+3..

P3) Set segUpdateValidDuration to 2 and set P=3. This should behave almost
identically to P1. It should only predict the next time step correctly and not
two time steps in advance. (Check off by one error in this logic.)

P4) As above, but with multiple sequences.

P5) Same as P3 but with shared subsequences.



Continuous mode tests
=====================

Slow changing inputs.


Orphan Decay Tests
==================


HiLo Tests
==========

A high order sequence memory like the TP can memorize very long sequences. In
many applications though you don't want to memorize. You see a long sequence of
patterns but there are actually lower order repeating sequences embedded within
it.  A simplistic example is words in a sentence. Words such as You'd like the TP to learn those sequences.

Tests should capture number of synapses learned and compare against
theoretically optimal numbers to pass/fail.

HL0a) For debugging, similar to H0. We want to learn a 3 pattern long sequence presented
with noise before and after, with no resets. Two steps of noise will be presented.
The noise will be 20 patterns, presented in random order. Every pattern has a
consecutive set of 5 bits on, so the vector will be 115 bits long. No pattern
shares any columns with the others. These sequences are easy to visualize and is
very useful for debugging.

TP parameters should be the same as B7 except that permanenceDec should be 0.05:

    activationThreshold = newSynapseCount
    minThreshold = activationThreshold
    initialPerm = 0.2
    connectedPerm = 0.7
    permanenceInc = 0.2
    permanenceDec = 0.05

So, this means it should learn a sequence after 4 repetitions. It will take
4 orphan decay steps to get an incorrect synapse to go away completely.

HL0b) Like HL0a, but after the 3-sequence is learned, try to learn a 4-sequence that
builds on the 3-sequence. For example, if learning A-B-C we train also on
D-A-B-C. It should learn that ABC is separate from DABC.  Note: currently this
test is disabled in the code. It is a bit tricky to test this. When you present DAB,
you should predict the same columns as when you present AB (i.e. in both cases
C should be predicted). However, the representation for C in DABC should be
different than the representation for C in ABC. Furthermore, when you present
AB, the representation for C should be an OR of the representation in DABC and ABC
since you could also be starting in the middle of the DABC sequence. All this is
actually happening in the code, but verified by visual inspection only.

HL1) Noise + sequence + noise + sequence repeatedly without resets until it has
learned that sequence. Train the TP repeatedly with N random sequences that all
share a single subsequence. Each random sequence can be 10 patterns long,
sharing a subsequence that is 5 patterns long. There should be no resets
between presentations.  Inference should then be on that 5 long shared subsequence.

Example (3-long shared subsequence):

A B C D E F G H I J
K L M D E F N O P Q
R S T D E F U V W X
Y Z 1 D E F 2 3 4 5

TP parameters should be the same as HL0.

HL2) Like HL1, but after A B C has learned, try to learn D A B C . It should learn
ABC is separate from DABC.

HL3) Like HL2, but test with resets.

HL4) Like HL1 but with minThreshold high. This should FAIL and learn a ton
of synapses.

HiLo but with true high order sequences embedded in noise

Present 25 sequences in random order with no resets but noise between
sequences (1-20 samples). Learn all 25 sequences. Test global decay vs non-zero
permanenceDec .

Pooling + HiLo Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
====================

Needs to be defined.


Global Decay Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
==================

Simple tests to ensure global decay is actually working.


Sequence Likelihood Tests
=========================

These tests are in the file TPLikelihood.py


Segment Learning Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
======================

Multi-attribute sequence tests.

SL1) Train the TP repeatedly using a single (multiple) sequence plus noise. The
sequence can be relatively short, say 20 patterns. No two consecutive patterns
in the sequence should share columns. Add random noise each time a pattern is
presented. The noise should be different for each presentation and can be equal
to the number of on bits in the pattern. After N iterations of the noisy
sequences, the TP should should achieve perfect inference on the true sequence.
There should be resets between each presentation of the sequence.

Check predictions in the sequence only. And test with clean sequences.

Vary percentage of bits that are signal vs noise.

Noise can be a fixed alphabet instead of being randomly generated.

HL2) As above, but with no resets.

Shared Column Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
===================

Carefully test what happens when consecutive patterns in a sequence share
columns.

Sequence Noise Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
====================

Note: I don't think these will work with the current logic. Need to discuss
whether we want to accommodate sequence noise like this.

SN1) Learn sequence with pooling up to T timesteps. Run inference on a sequence
and occasionally drop elements of a sequence. Inference should still work.

SN2) As above, but occasionally add a random pattern into a sequence.

SN3) A combination of the above two.


Capacity Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
==============

These are stress tests that verify that the temporal pooler can learn a large
number of sequences and can predict a large number of possible next steps. Some
research needs to be done first to understand the capacity of the system as it
relates to the number of columns, cells per column, etc.

Token Prediction Tests: Test how many predictions of individual tokens we can
superimpose and still recover.


Online Learning Tests [UNIMPLEMENTED]
=====================

These tests will verify that the temporal pooler continues to work even if
sequence statistics (and the actual sequences) change slowly over time. The TP
should adapt to the changes and learn to recognize newer sequences (and forget
the older sequences?).
