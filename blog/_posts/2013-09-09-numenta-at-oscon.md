At [OSCON 2013](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013) this past July, the Numenta team had the opportunity to give two presentations about cortical learning algorithms and NuPIC. Jeff Hawkins gave a short keynote talk entitled [On Open Intelligence](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/speaker/130998), which created a decent amount of conversation. OSCON has provided a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_eT5bsS4bQ" rel="prettyPhoto" title="On Open Intelligence Video">great video of Jeff's keynote</a>. Here are some twitter reactions to Jeff's talk:

There was a lot of interest in the brain-inspired technology behind NuPIC, as depicted in this [blog post](http://www.jeffkramer.com/2013/07/29/oscon-2013-the-source-must-flow/):

> The most interesting keynote, though, was from Numenta.  ... The science is beyond me, but the demo and keynote was great, and you can (should) watch it on YouTube.  I went to their panel later, and they recommended Jeff’s book On Intelligence as a primer for those interested.  There are code samples (in Python!) with the NuPIC library up on their github account.

Soon after Jeff's talk, [Carin Meier](https://twitter.com/carinmeier) presented about [The Joy of Flying Robots with Clojure](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/29559), and of course the audience made some typical associations.

Scott and I also presented [a technical session](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2013/public/schedule/detail/30342) about [NuPIC]({{ site.baseurl }}/nupic.html). OSCON staff have not made the video available yet, but it is supposed to be available sometime in November. 

__*Watch for the NuPIC Technical video in this space as soon as it is posted.*__

After the session, the Q/A was running long, so we stayed around and answered questions in the hallway for another 30 minutes. As portrayed in [an attendee's blog post](http://blog.profitbricks.com/oscon-keynote-day-1-recap/), *"the line to talk to Jeff and his engineers afterward was 7 people deep at least."*

At some point during the conference, Simon Phipps from [Twit.tv](http://twit.tv/floss259) pulled Jeff aside and recorded <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V08QmAz9MyI" rel="prettyPhoto" title="Jeff Hawkins at OSCON 2013: FLOSS 259">this interview with him</a>.

We also had the opportunity to hold a Birds of a Feather (BOF) session, which drew around 30 people and lasted for over 90 minutes. Although I hadn't thought of recording this session, a persistent community member (you know who you are) prodded me into an ad-hoc A/V session, and I managed to get a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xr2Vtom3TcU" rel="prettyPhoto" title="Intelligent Computing BOF OSCON 2013 with Jeff Hawkins">somewhat-digestible video online</a>. Sorry for the awful audio, but this was my first ad-hoc live-streaming experience. I promise, it will be better next time!

All-in-all, OSCON was great fun and a wonderful way to spread the word about NuPIC and our open source community. We even got a chance to meet a few friends from our mailing list who lived in the Portland area. Thanks to everyone who made it to the BOF sessions and showed interested in our technology.
