Last weekend's hackathon was a lot of fun. Thanks to everyone for coming out. We gave several educational presentations and held some working sessions. The participation from the attendees was outstanding. 

Thanks again to <a href="http://about.tagged.com">Tagged</a>, who generously donated some of their workspace to us for the event. The Tagged offices are very cool, and in a great part of San Francisco.

We had over 50 people attend the hackathon from across the United States and Europe, most of whom stuck around for the demos after the 30-hour hack period. In all, we had <a href="#demos">7 impressive demos</a>! Only a couple were <em>natural language processing</em> hacks, but that's okay. It was great to see NuPIC users making their ideas a reality in whichever direction they chose to apply it.

<h3 id="videos"><a href="#videos">Videos</a></h3>

We tried to record everything we could, which included all the sessions (minus one because of a technical glitch). My apologies for the poor audio and video in some of these. We had a wireless microphone failure because of unanticipated RF interference. We attempted to live-stream everything on YouTube via Google Hangout, which meant we sacrificed quality. For future hackathons, I plan to have better tools in place.

> Most of the changes on our senses are due, wholly or in part, to our own actions. Therefore, the neocortex learns a sensory-motor model of the world. In this talk, Jeff discussed some of what we know about how the neocortex generates behavior and how we might construct a simple sensory-motor system based on the Cortical Learning Algorithm. It is a good starting point for anyone wanting to add motor output to the CLA.

    <p>Matt compiled and ran NuPIC on a Raspberry Pi, and wired up some wheels, a controller, and light-sensitive sensors to help drive it. While he programmed it to continuously steer towards the brightest light source, he used NuPIC's anomaly scores of the light input from right and left to stop the vehicle when it wandered into unexpected territory.</p>

    <p>This hack intends to give the CLA an ability to evaluate hypothetical input. Imagine that you want to assess (predict) what the consequences of some action (input) would be. You may have a set of possible inputs (as alternatives), and want to evaluate which would lead to the best (predicted) outcome. The demonstration will include mice, a maze, and some cheese.</p>

    <p>This team taught the CLA to learn to control a quadcopter. Their objective was to pilot the quadcopter by controlling its vertical speed to fly to a desired altitude and hover there. The supervised learning approach involved having the CLA watch an expert flyer and learn those sequences, and use its prediction of those sequences to directly control the copter in the face of noise.</p>

    <p>Subutai used the word SDR association framework defined in <a href="http://github.com/rhyolight/nupic_nlp">nupic_nlp</a> to associate three word phrases, teaching it sentences like "elephants eat leaves", "dogs like sleep", and "cows eat grass". After some training, Subutai asks NuPIC, "<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jofNR_WkoCE">What does the fox eat?</a>" Find out the answer by watching the video!</p>

Lastly, our CEO and Chairman of the Grok/Numenta Board, Donna Dubinsky, said <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4XjYXFRIAQ&amp;start=8506" rel="prettyPhoto" title="Thanks, from Donna Dubinsky">a few inspirational words</a> at the end of the hackathon. Thanks, Donna!

This was a really fun event to plan, and it emphasizes what a great community we have with NuPIC. Thank you everyone, for helping make this open source project what it is today. I am looking forward to planning our next hackathon this Spring!
