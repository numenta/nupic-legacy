Hot Gym Code Example
--------------------

The `"hot gym" <https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/examples/opf/clients/hotgym>`_
sample application has been around for a long time, and was one of the first
real-world applications of NuPIC that proved the value of cortically-inspired
learning algorithms. The data used is real energy consumption data from a gym in
Australia, which simply contains a timestamp and float value for energy
consumption.

The "hot gym" sample application has been around for a long time, and was one of
the first real-world applications of NuPIC that actually worked. The data used
is real energy consumption data from a gym in Australia. It is aggregated hourly
already, so the input CSV file simply contains a timestamp and float value for
energy consumption during that hour.

This collection of tutorials uses the "Hot Gym" premise to illustrate many ways
users can set up and run a NuPIC application against real-world data.
