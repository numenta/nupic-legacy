The Network API
---------------

The Network API is a lower-level API designed to allow users the power and
flexibility to construct hierarchical structures of nodes. Watch this video for
an overview:

The Network API interface is defined in C++, but also exported in a Python
interface. So it can be used from either C++ or Python.

    An HTM Network is a collection of Regions that implement HTM algorithms and
    other algorithms. The Network Engine allows users to create and manipulate
    HTM Networks.
