The Online Prediction Framework (OPF)
-------------------------------------

The OPF is a Python-only convenience library that uses the
`Network API <../api/network.html>`_ to construct commonly used models. The primary
classes it exposes to users are the :class:`.CLAModel` and
the :class:`.ModelFactory`.

Online Prediction Framework (OPF) is a framework for working with and deriving
predictions from online learning algorithms, including HTM. OPF is designed to
work in conjunction with a larger architecture, as well as in a standalone mode
(i.e. directly from the command line). It is also designed such that new model
algorithms and functionalities can be added with minimal code changes.

Here are some examples of applications using the OPF interface:

- `examples/opf/clients/hotgym/prediction/one_gym <https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/examples/opf/clients/hotgym/prediction/one_gym>`_
- `examples/opf/clients/hotgym/anomaly <https://github.com/numenta/nupic/tree/master/examples/opf/clients/hotgym/anomaly>`_
