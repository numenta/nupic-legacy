    # the weaker columns are suppressed.
    # In the case where globalInhibition is turned on (only one inhibition area)

    # set by the internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in turn
    # determined from the average size of the connected receptive fields of all
    # columns). When using this method, as columns learn and grow their
    # effective receptive fields, the inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the
