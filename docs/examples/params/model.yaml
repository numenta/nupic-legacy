    # The desired density of active columns within a local inhibition area

    # the weaker columns are suppressed.
    # In the case where globalInhibition is turned on (only one inhibition area)
    # numActiveColumnsPerInhArea should be set to 40. Because 40 means roughly
    # 2% active mini-columns. Given that there is only one inhibition area:
    # 40 / 2048 = 0.0195 so ~2% active mini-columns.

    # columns remain ON within a local inhibition area (the size of which is
    # set by the internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in turn
    # determined from the average size of the connected receptive fields of all
    # columns). When using this method, as columns learn and grow their
    # effective receptive fields, the inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the
    # net density of the active columns will *decrease*. This is in contrast to
    # the localAreaDensity method, which keeps the density of active columns
    # the same regardless of the size of their receptive fields.
