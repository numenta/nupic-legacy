# Redirects

These files and folders are here to provide redirects from old URLs to new ones. Before the blog was split into 'news' and 'blog' sections, there was only a 'news' section. To preserve old URLs that are already linked to from many places on the internet, they are preserved here with a JavaScript script to change to the proper location.
