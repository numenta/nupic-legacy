### Finally!

We're very happy to announce that as of [Aug 15](https://travis-ci.org/numenta/nupic/builds/10292937), NuPIC now supports Python 2.7 as well as Python 2.6! Many thanks to our excellent and proactive [community]({{ site.baseurl }}/community.html) for seeing this obvious need and fulfilling it. This opens up a lot of doors for more people to use and join our project.
