We're having a NuPIC Hackathon on June 21, and we have about ~~&nbsp;ten&nbsp;~~ five spaces available for more participants. *First come, first served!* It will be in the San Francisco Bay Area. If you are interested in attending, please contact me directly at <matt@numenta.org>.

Like Jeff [said earlier]({{ site.baseurl }}/news/2013/06/03/introducing-nupic.html), this stuff is not easy. The Cortical Learning Algorithm is based on novel concepts that present a steep learning curve. I'd recommend you have at least one of the following qualities before you contact me to attend. If you have both, then you're our target market for this Hackathon, and you should seriously think about coming!

- background in computational neuroscience
- programming skills with C++ or python

The event will kick off with a short message from Jeff Hawkins, founder of Numenta and author of **On Intelligence**. Afterwards, there will be a technical introduction to the [NuPIC codebase](http://github.com/numenta/nupic), along with an example application and some guidance for participants.

During the event, CLA experts will be available to help hackers work with the NuPIC library.

At 5PM on Saturday June 22, participants will have the chance to showcase their work before the group. The best entries will receive prizes!

There will be pizza and beer available Friday night, coffee Saturday morning, and sandwiches Saturday for lunch.

*Technical requirements:* linux (but we'll have VMs available if you only have a Windows laptop), python 2.6, gcc.
