'''
This module implements the Feature Flags system.

Summary:

  Based on the environment your program is run in you may want various features
  to be displayed and others not.

  Based on the type of user who is using Nupic you may want them to see various
  features and not others.

  These two things can be accomplished using Feature Flags.

  Feature Flags wrap sections of code in IF/THEN blocks to isolate functionality
  from running code.

  This allows you to inline new features without branching files into file.py and
  file2.py.

  This also allows you to release un-tested, underdevelopment, or experimental
  features directly to production with confidence that those code paths won't
  get run until such time as they are 'released' to a group of users for testing
  or to all users for a launch.

  DEV NOTE: To set personal Feature Flag over-rides copy conf/devconf-example.py
            to devconf.py and edit as desired.
