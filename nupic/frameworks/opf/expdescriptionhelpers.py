  the definition of the dictionary itself (before the dictionary's own defintion
  is complete).

  NOTE: may be used by base and sub-experiments to derive their own custom value
    getters; however, their use is applicapble only where permitted, as
    described in comments within descriptionTemplate.tpl. See class
