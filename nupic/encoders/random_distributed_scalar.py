class RandomDistributedScalarEncoder(Encoder):
  """
  A scalar encoder encodes a numeric (floating point) value into an array
  of bits.

  This class maps a scalar value into a random distributed representation that
  is suitable as scalar input into the spatial pooler. The encoding scheme is
  designed to replace a simple ScalarEncoder. It preserves the important
  properties around overlapping representations. Unlike ScalarEncoder the min
  and max range can be dynamically increased without any negative effects. The
  only required parameter is resolution, which determines the resolution of
  input values.

  Scalar values are mapped to a bucket. The class maintains a random distributed
  encoding for each bucket. The following properties are maintained by
  RandomDistributedEncoder:

  1) Similar scalars should have high overlap. Overlap should decrease smoothly
  as scalars become less similar. Specifically, neighboring bucket indices must
  overlap by a linearly decreasing number of bits.

  2) Dissimilar scalars should have very low overlap so that the SP does not
  confuse representations. Specifically, buckets that are more than w indices
  apart should have at most maxOverlap bits of overlap. We arbitrarily (and
  safely) define "very low" to be 2 bits of overlap or lower.

  Properties 1 and 2 lead to the following overlap rules for buckets i and j:

      If abs(i-j) < w then:
        overlap(i,j) = w - abs(i-j)
      else:
        overlap(i,j) <= maxOverlap

  3) The representation for a scalar must not change during the lifetime of
  the object. Specifically, as new buckets are created and the min/max range
  is extended, the representation for previously in-range sscalars and
  previously created buckets must not change.

    """Constructor

    @param resolution A floating point positive number denoting the resolution
                    of the output representation. Numbers within
                    [offset-resolution/2, offset+resolution/2] will fall into
                    the same bucket and thus have an identical representation.
                    Adjacent buckets will differ in one bit. resolution is a
                    required parameter.

    @param w Number of bits to set in output. w must be odd to avoid centering
                    problems.  w must be large enough that spatial pooler
                    columns will have a sufficiently large overlap to avoid
                    false matches. A value of w=21 is typical.

    @param n Number of bits in the representation (must be > w). n must be
                    large enough such that there is enough room to select
                    new representations as the range grows. With w=21 a value
                    of n=400 is typical. The class enforces n > 6*w.

    @param name An optional string which will become part of the description.

    @param offset A floating point offset used to map scalar inputs to bucket
                    indices. The middle bucket will correspond to numbers in the
                    range [offset - resolution/2, offset + resolution/2). If set
                    to None, the very first input that is encoded will be used
                    to determine the offset.

    @param seed The seed used for numpy's random number generator. If set to -1
                    the generator will be initialized without a fixed seed.

    @param verbosity An integer controlling the level of debugging output. A
                    value of 0 implies no output. verbosity=1 may lead to
                    one-time printouts during construction, serialization or
                    deserialization. verbosity=2 may lead to some output per
                    encode operation. verbosity>2 may lead to significantly
                    more output.
