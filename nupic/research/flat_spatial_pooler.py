  """
  This class implements the flat spatial pooler. This version of the spatial 
  pooler contains no toplogy information. It uses global coverage and global
  inhibition. It implements 'high tier' learning.
  
  High tier learning gives preference to unlearned columns. An unlearned
  column will always win unless another column has learned to perfectly
  represent an input pattern.  Once this initial phase has passed, it should
  behave like the normal spatial pooler. This option is useful if you might
  encounter very small datasets where you might want a unique representation
  for every input, regardless of similarity.
  
  The randomSP option allows you to use a flat spatial pooler without invoking
  any learning. This is extremely useful for understanding the properties of a
  basic SP that is initialized with random permanences. A randomSP will give
  reasonable SDR's and is easier to analyze and reason about. (A properly
  trained SP should give even better SDR's.) You can't achieve this function
  with SpatialPooler because it normally strips out unlearned columns when
  learning is turned off. If the randomSP functionality is generally useful, we
  might move this option to SpatialPooler.

    This is the primary public method of the SpatialPooler class. This function
    takes a input vector and outputs the indices of the active columns. If
    'learn' is set to True, and randomSP is set to false, this method also
    updates the permanences of the columns.

    Parameters:
    ----------------------------
    inputVector:    a numpy array of 0's and 1's thata comprises the input to 
                    the spatial pooler. The array will be treated as a one
                    dimensional array, therefore the dimensions of the array
                    do not have to much the exact dimensions specified in the 
                    class constructor. In fact, even a list would suffice. 
                    The number of input bits in the vector must, however, 
                    match the number of bits specified by the call to the 
                    constructor. Therefore there must be a '0' or '1' in the
                    array for every input bit.
    learn:          a boolean value indicating whether learning should be 
                    performed. Learning entails updating the  permanence 
                    values of the synapses, and hence modifying the 'state' 
                    of the model. Setting learning to 'off' freezes the SP
                    and has many uses. For example, you might want to feed in
                    various inputs and examine the resulting SDR's.
