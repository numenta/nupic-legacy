    Parameters:
    ----------------------------
    inputShape:           The dimensions of the input vector. Format is (height,
                          width) e.g. (24, 72). If the input is from a sensor,
                          it is interpreted as having a 2-D topology of 24
                          pixels high and 72 wide.
    inputBorder:          The first column from an edge will be centered
                          over an input which is 'inputBorder' inputs from the
                          edge.
    inputDensity:         The density of the input. This is only to aid in
                          figuring out the initial number of connected synapses
                          to place on each column. The lower the inputDensity,
                          the more initial connections will be assigned to each
                          column.
    coincidencesShape:    The dimensions of column layout. Format is (height,
                          width) e.g. (80,100) means a total of 80*100 = 800 are
                          arranged in a 2-D topology with 80 rows and
                          100 columns.
    coincInputRadius:     This defines the max radius of the receptive field of
                          each column. This is used to limit memory requirements
                          and processing time. It could be set large enough to
                          encompass the entire input field and the SP would
                          still work fine, but require more memory and
                          processing time.
                          This parameter defines a square area: a column will
                          have a max square RF with sides of length
                          2 * coincInputRadius + 1.
    coincInputPoolPct     What percent of the columns's receptive field is
                          available for potential synapses. At initialization
                          time, we will choose
                          coincInputPoolPct * (2*coincInputRadius + 1)^2
                          potential synapses from the receptive field.
    gaussianDist:         If true, the initial permanences assigned to each
                          column will have a gaussian distribution to them,
                          making the column favor inputs directly below it over
                          inputs farther away. If false, the initial permanences
                          will have a random distribution across the column's
                          entire potential receptive field.
    commonDistributions:  If set to True (the default, faster startup time),
                          each column will be given the same initial permanence
                          values.
                          This is normally OK when you will be training, but if
                          you will be sticking with the untrained network,
                          you will want to set this to False (which makes
                          startup take longer).
    localAreaDensity:     The desired density of active columns within a local
                          inhibition area (the size of which is set by the
                          internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in
                          turn determined from the average size of the connected
                          receptive fields of all columns). The inhibition logic
                          will insure that at most N columns remain ON within a
                          local inhibition area, where N = localAreaDensity *
                          (total number of columns in inhibition area).
    numActivePerInhArea:  An alternate way to control the density of the active
                          columns. If numActivePerInhArea is specified then
                          localAreaDensity must be -1, and vice versa. When
                          using numActivePerInhArea, the inhibition logic will
                          insure that at most 'numActivePerInhArea' columns
                          remain ON within a local inhibition area (the size of
                          which is set by the internally calculated
                          inhibitionRadius, which is in turn determined from the
                          average size of the connected receptive fields of all
                          columns). When using this method, as columns learn and
                          grow their effective receptive fields, the
                          inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the net density
                          of the active columns will *decrease*. This is in
                          contrast to the localAreaDensity method, which keeps
                          the density of active columns the same regardless of
                          the size of their receptive fields.
    stimulusThreshold:    This is a number specifying the minimum number of
                          synapses that must be on in order for a columns to
                          turn ON.
                          The purpose of this is to prevent noise input from
                          activating columns.
    synPermInactiveDec:   How much an inactive synapse is decremented, specified
                          as a percent of a fully grown synapse.
    synPermActiveInc:     How much to increase the permanence of an active
                          synapse, specified as a percent of a fully grown
                          synapse.
    synPermActiveSharedDec: How much to decrease the permanence of an active
                          synapse which is connected to another column that is
                          active at the same time. Specified as a percent of a
                          fully grown synapse.
    synPermOrphanDec:     How much to decrease the permanence of an active
                          synapse on a column which has high overlap with the
                          input, but was inhibited (an "orphan" column).
    synPermConnected:     The default connected threshold. Any synapse whose
                          permanence value is above the connected threshold is
                          a "connected synapse", meaning it can contribute to
                          the cell's firing. Typical value is 0.10. Cells whose
                          activity level before inhibition falls below
                          minDutyCycleBeforeInh will have their own internal
                          synPermConnectedCell threshold set below this default
                          value.
                          (This concept applies to both SP and TP and so 'cells'
                          is correct here as opposed to 'columns')
    minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh: A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set a floor on
                          how often a column should have at least
                          stimulusThreshold active inputs. Periodically, each
                          column looks at the duty cycle before inhibition of
                          all other column within its inhibition radius and sets
                          its own internal minimal acceptable duty cycle to:
                            minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh *
                            max(other columns' duty cycles).
                          On each iteration, any column whose duty cycle before
                          inhibition falls below this computed value will  get
                          all of its permanence values boosted up by
                          synPermActiveInc. Raising all permanences in response
                          to a sub-par duty cycle before  inhibition allows a
                          cell to search for new inputs when either its
                          previously learned inputs are no longer ever active,
                          or when the vast majority of them have been "hijacked"
                          by other columns due to the no-dupe rule.
    minPctDutyCycleAfterInh: A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set a floor on
                          how often a column should turn ON after inhibition.
                          Periodically, each column looks at the duty cycle
                          after inhibition of all other columns within its
                          inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal
                          acceptable duty cycle to:
                            minPctDutyCycleAfterInh *
                            max(other columns' duty cycles).
                          On each iteration, any column whose duty cycle after
                          inhibition falls below this computed value will get
                          its internal boost factor increased.
    dutyCyclePeriod:      The period used to calculate duty cycles. Higher
                          values make it take longer to respond to changes in
                          boost or synPerConnectedCell. Shorter values make it
                          more unstable and likely to oscillate.
    maxFiringBoost:       The maximum firing level boost factor. Each column's
                          raw firing strength gets multiplied by a boost factor
                          before it gets considered for inhibition.
                          The actual boost factor for a column is number between
                          1.0 and maxFiringBoost. A boost factor of 1.0 is used
                          if the duty cycle is >= minDutyCycle, maxFiringBoost
                          is used if the duty cycle is 0, and any duty cycle in
                          between is linearly extrapolated from these 2
                          endpoints.
    maxSSFiringBoost:     Once a column turns ON, it's boost will immediately
                          fall down to maxSSFiringBoost if it is above it. This
                          is accomplished by internally raising it's computed
                          duty cycle accordingly. This prevents a cell which has
                          had it's boost raised extremely high from turning ON
                          for too many diverse inputs in a row within a short
                          period of time.
    maxSynPermBoost:      The maximum synPermActiveInc boost factor. Each
                          column's synPermActiveInc gets multiplied by a boost
                          factor to make the column more or less likely to form
                          new connections.
                          The actual boost factor used is a number between
                          1.0 and maxSynPermBoost. A boost factor of 1.0 is used
                          if the duty cycle is >= minDutyCycle, maxSynPermBoost
                          is used if the duty cycle is 0, and any duty cycle
                          in between is linearly extrapolated from these 2
                          endpoints.
    minDistance:          This parameter impacts how finely the input space is
                          quantized. It is a value between 0 and 1.0. If set
                          to 0, then every unique input presentation will
                          generate a unique output representation, within the
                          limits of the total number of columns available.
                          Higher values will tend to group similar inputs
                          together into the same output representation. Only
                          column which overlap with the input less than
                          100*(1.0-minDistance) percent will
                          have a possibility of losing the inhibition
                          competition against a boosted, 'bored' cell.
    cloneMap:             An array (numColumnsHigh, numColumnsWide) that
                          contains the clone index to use for each column.
    numCloneMasters:      The number of distinct clones in the map.  This
                          is just outputCloningWidth*outputCloningHeight.
    seed:                 Seed for our own pseudo-random number generator.
    spVerbosity:          spVerbosity level: 0, 1, 2, or 3
    printPeriodicStats:   If > 0, then every 'printPeriodicStats' iterations,
                          the SP will print to stdout some statistics related to
                          learning, such as the average pct under and
                          over-coverage, average number of active columns, etc.
                          in the last 'showLearningStats' iterations.
    testMode:             If True, run the SP in test mode. This runs both the
                          C++ and python implementations on all internal
                          functions that support both and insures that both
                          produce the same result.
    globalInhibition:     If true, enforce the
                          localAreaDensity/numActivePerInhArea
                          globally over the entire region, ignoring any
                          dynamically calculated inhibitionRadius. In effect,
                          this is the same as setting the inhibition radius to
                          include the entire region.
    spReconstructionParam:Specifies which SP reconstruction optimization to be
                          used. Each column's firing strength is weighted by the
                          percent Overlap, permanence or duty Cycle if this

    useHighTier:          The "high tier" feature is to deal with sparse input
                          spaces. If over (1-minDistance) percent of a column's
                          connected synapses are active, it will automatically
                          become one of the winning columns.

                          If False, columns are activated based on their absolute
                          overlap with the input. Also, boosting will be
                          disabled to prevent pattern oscillation

                          will instead use it's initial configuration for all
