/**
 * Try to match the string to the given pattern, return APR_SUCCESS if
 *    match, else return APR_FNM_NOMATCH.  Note that there is no such thing as
 *    an illegal pattern.
 *
 * With all flags unset, a pattern is interpreted as such:
 *
 * PATTERN: Backslash followed by any character, including another
 *          backslash.<br/>
 * MATCHES: That character exactly.
 * 
 * <p>
 * PATTERN: ?<br/>
 * MATCHES: Any single character.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * PATTERN: *<br/>
 * MATCHES: Any sequence of zero or more characters. (Note that multiple
 *          *s in a row are equivalent to one.)
 * 
 * PATTERN: Any character other than \?*[ or a \ at the end of the pattern<br/>
 * MATCHES: That character exactly. (Case sensitive.)
 * 
 * PATTERN: [ followed by a class description followed by ]<br/>
 * MATCHES: A single character described by the class description.
 *          (Never matches, if the class description reaches until the
 *          end of the string without a ].) If the first character of
 *          the class description is ^ or !, the sense of the description
 *          is reversed.  The rest of the class description is a list of
 *          single characters or pairs of characters separated by -. Any
 *          of those characters can have a backslash in front of them,
 *          which is ignored; this lets you use the characters ] and -
 *          in the character class, as well as ^ and ! at the
 *          beginning.  The pattern matches a single character if it
 *          is one of the listed characters or falls into one of the
 *          listed ranges (inclusive, case sensitive).  Ranges with
 *          the first character larger than the second are legal but
 *          never match. Edge cases: [] never matches, and [^] and [!]
 *          always match without consuming a character.
 * 
 * Note that these patterns attempt to match the entire string, not
 * just find a substring matching the pattern.
 *
 * @param pattern The pattern to match to
 * @param strings The string we are trying to match
 * @param flags flags to use in the match.  Bitwise OR of:
 * <pre>
 *              APR_FNM_NOESCAPE       Disable backslash escaping
 *              APR_FNM_PATHNAME       Slash must be matched by slash
 *              APR_FNM_PERIOD         Period must be matched by period
 *              APR_FNM_CASE_BLIND     Compare characters case-insensitively.
