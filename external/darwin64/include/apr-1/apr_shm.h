 * @param filename The file to use for shared memory on platforms that
 *        require it.
 * @param pool the pool from which to allocate the shared memory
 *        structure.
 * @remark A note about Anonymous vs. Named shared memory segments:
 *         Not all plaforms support anonymous shared memory segments, but in
 *         some cases it is prefered over other types of shared memory
 *         implementations. Passing a NULL 'file' parameter to this function
 *         will cause the subsystem to use anonymous shared memory segments.
 *         If such a system is not available, APR_ENOTIMPL is returned.
 * @remark A note about allocation sizes:
 *         On some platforms it is necessary to store some metainformation
 *         about the segment within the actual segment. In order to supply
 *         the caller with the requested size it may be necessary for the
 *         implementation to request a slightly greater segment length
 *         from the subsystem. In all cases, the apr_shm_baseaddr_get()
 *         function will return the first usable byte of memory.
