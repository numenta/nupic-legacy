/**
 * The one-sentence buzzword-laden overview: Bucket brigades represent
 * a complex data stream that can be passed through a layered IO
 * system without unnecessary copying. A longer overview follows...
 *
 * A bucket brigade is a doubly linked list (ring) of buckets, so we
 * aren't limited to inserting at the front and removing at the end.
 * Buckets are only passed around as members of a brigade, although
 * singleton buckets can occur for short periods of time.
 *
 * Buckets are data stores of various types. They can refer to data in
 * memory, or part of a file or mmap area, or the output of a process,
 * etc. Buckets also have some type-dependent accessor functions:
 * read, split, copy, setaside, and destroy.
 *
 * read returns the address and size of the data in the bucket. If the
 * data isn't in memory then it is read in and the bucket changes type
 * so that it can refer to the new location of the data. If all the
 * data doesn't fit in the bucket then a new bucket is inserted into
 * the brigade to hold the rest of it.
 *
 * split divides the data in a bucket into two regions. After a split
 * the original bucket refers to the first part of the data and a new
 * bucket inserted into the brigade after the original bucket refers
 * to the second part of the data. Reference counts are maintained as
 * necessary.
 *
 * setaside ensures that the data in the bucket has a long enough
 * lifetime. Sometimes it is convenient to create a bucket referring
 * to data on the stack in the expectation that it will be consumed
 * (output to the network) before the stack is unwound. If that
 * expectation turns out not to be valid, the setaside function is
 * called to move the data somewhere safer.
 *
 * copy makes a duplicate of the bucket structure as long as it's
 * possible to have multiple references to a single copy of the
 * data itself.  Not all bucket types can be copied.
 *
 * destroy maintains the reference counts on the resources used by a
 * bucket and frees them if necessary.
 *
 * Note: all of the above functions have wrapper macros (apr_bucket_read(),
 * apr_bucket_destroy(), etc), and those macros should be used rather
 * than using the function pointers directly.
 *
 * To write a bucket brigade, they are first made into an iovec, so that we
 * don't write too little data at one time.  Currently we ignore compacting the
 * buckets into as few buckets as possible, but if we really want good
 * performance, then we need to compact the buckets before we convert to an
 * iovec, or possibly while we are converting to an iovec.

/**
 * Read some data from the bucket.
 *
 * The apr_bucket_read function returns a convenient amount of data
 * from the bucket provided, writing the address and length of the
 * data to the pointers provided by the caller. The function tries
 * as hard as possible to avoid a memory copy.
 *
 * Buckets are expected to be a member of a brigade at the time they
 * are read.
 *
 * In typical application code, buckets are read in a loop, and after
 * each bucket is read and processed, it is moved or deleted from the
 * brigade and the next bucket read.
 *
 * The definition of "convenient" depends on the type of bucket that
 * is being read, and is decided by APR. In the case of memory based
 * buckets such as heap and immortal buckets, a pointer will be
 * returned to the location of the buffer containing the complete
 * contents of the bucket.
 *
 * Some buckets, such as the socket bucket, might have no concept
 * of length. If an attempt is made to read such a bucket, the
 * apr_bucket_read function will read a convenient amount of data
 * from the socket. The socket bucket is magically morphed into a
 * heap bucket containing the just-read data, and a new socket bucket
 * is inserted just after this heap bucket.
 *
 * To understand why apr_bucket_read might do this, consider the loop
 * described above to read and process buckets. The current bucket
 * is magically morphed into a heap bucket and returned to the caller.
 * The caller processes the data, and deletes the heap bucket, moving
 * onto the next bucket, the new socket bucket. This process repeats,
 * giving the illusion of a bucket brigade that contains potentially
 * infinite amounts of data. It is up to the caller to decide at what
 * point to stop reading buckets.
 *
 * Some buckets, such as the file bucket, might have a fixed size,
 * but be significantly larger than is practical to store in RAM in
 * one go. As with the socket bucket, if an attempt is made to read
 * from a file bucket, the file bucket is magically morphed into a
 * heap bucket containing a convenient amount of data read from the
 * current offset in the file. During the read, the offset will be
 * moved forward on the file, and a new file bucket will be inserted
 * directly after the current bucket representing the remainder of the
 * file. If the heap bucket was large enough to store the whole
 * remainder of the file, no more file buckets are inserted, and the
 * file bucket will disappear completely.
 *
 * The pattern for reading buckets described above does create the
 * illusion that the code is willing to swallow buckets that might be
 * too large for the system to handle in one go. This however is just
 * an illusion: APR will always ensure that large (file) or infinite
 * (socket) buckets are broken into convenient bite sized heap buckets
 * before data is returned to the caller.
 *
 * There is a potential gotcha to watch for: if buckets are read in a
 * loop, and aren't deleted after being processed, the potentially large
 * bucket will slowly be converted into RAM resident heap buckets. If
 * the file is larger than available RAM, an out of memory condition
 * could be caused if the application is not careful to manage this.
