# TODO:
# * Loop Delay is broken on GTKAgg. This is because source_remove() is not
#   working as we want. PyGTK bug?
# * Documentation -- this will need a new section of the User's Guide.
#      Both for Animations and just timers.
#   - Also need to update http://www.scipy.org/Cookbook/Matplotlib/Animations
# * Blit
#   * Currently broken with Qt4 for widgets that don't start on screen
#   * Still a few edge cases that aren't working correctly
#   * Can this integrate better with existing matplotlib animation artist flag?
#     - If animated removes from default draw(), perhaps we could use this to
#       simplify initial draw.
# * Example
#   * Frameless animation - pure procedural with no loop
#   * Need example that uses something like inotify or subprocess
#   * Complex syncing examples
# * Movies
#   * Can blit be enabled for movies?
# * Need to consider event sources to allow clicking through multiple figures

    Base class for writing movies. Fundamentally, what a MovieWriter does
    is provide is a way to grab frames by calling grab_frame(). setup()
    is called to start the process and finish() is called afterwards.
    This class is set up to provide for writing movie frame data to a pipe.
    saving() is provided as a context manager to facilitate this process as::

      with moviewriter.saving('myfile.mp4'):
          # Iterate over frames
          moviewriter.grab_frame()

    The use of the context manager ensures that setup and cleanup are
    performed as necessary.

        Saves a movie file by drawing every frame.

        *filename* is the output filename, e.g., :file:`mymovie.mp4`

        *writer* is either an instance of :class:`MovieWriter` or a string
        key that identifies a class to use, such as 'ffmpeg' or 'mencoder'.
        If nothing is passed, the value of the rcparam `animation.writer` is
        used.

        *fps* is the frames per second in the movie. Defaults to None,
        which will use the animation's specified interval to set the frames
        per second.

        *dpi* controls the dots per inch for the movie frames. This combined
        with the figure's size in inches controls the size of the movie.

        *codec* is the video codec to be used. Not all codecs are supported
        by a given :class:`MovieWriter`. If none is given, this defaults to the
        value specified by the rcparam `animation.codec`.

        *bitrate* specifies the amount of bits used per second in the
        compressed movie, in kilobits per second. A higher number means a
        higher quality movie, but at the cost of increased file size. If no
        value is given, this defaults to the value given by the rcparam
        `animation.bitrate`.

        *extra_args* is a list of extra string arguments to be passed to the
        underlying movie utiltiy. The default is None, which passes the
        additional argurments in the 'animation.extra_args' rcParam.

        *metadata* is a dictionary of keys and values for metadata to include
        in the output file. Some keys that may be of use include:
        title, artist, genre, subject, copyright, srcform, comment.

        *extra_anim* is a list of additional `Animation` objects that should
        be included in the saved movie file. These need to be from the same
        `matplotlib.Figure` instance. Also, animation frames will just be
        simply combined, so there should be a 1:1 correspondence between
        the frames from the different animations.

        *savefig_kwargs* is a dictionary containing keyword arguments to be
        passed on to the 'savefig' command which is called repeatedly to save
        the individual frames. This can be used to set tight bounding boxes,
        for example.
