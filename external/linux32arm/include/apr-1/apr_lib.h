/**
 * apr_vformatter() is a generic printf-style formatting routine
 * with some extensions.
 * @param flush_func The function to call when the buffer is full
 * @param c The buffer to write to
 * @param fmt The format string
 * @param ap The arguments to use to fill out the format string.
 *
 * @remark
 * <PRE>
 * The extensions are:
 *
 * %%pA	takes a struct in_addr *, and prints it as a.b.c.d
 * %%pI	takes an apr_sockaddr_t * and prints it as a.b.c.d:port or
 *      [ipv6-address]:port
 * %%pT takes an apr_os_thread_t * and prints it in decimal
 *      ('0' is printed if !APR_HAS_THREADS)
 * %%pt takes an apr_os_thread_t * and prints it in hexadecimal
 *      ('0' is printed if !APR_HAS_THREADS)
 * %%pm takes an apr_status_t * and prints the appropriate error
 *      string (from apr_strerror) corresponding to that error code.
 * %%pp takes a void * and outputs it in hex
 * %%pB takes a apr_uint32_t * as bytes and outputs it's apr_strfsize
 * %%pF same as above, but takes a apr_off_t *
 * %%pS same as above, but takes a apr_size_t *
 *
 * %%pA, %%pI, %%pT, %%pp are available from APR 1.0.0 onwards (and in 0.9.x).
 * %%pt is only available from APR 1.2.0 onwards.
 * %%pm, %%pB, %%pF and %%pS are only available from APR 1.3.0 onwards.
 *
 * The %%p hacks are to force gcc's printf warning code to skip
 * over a pointer argument without complaining.  This does
 * mean that the ANSI-style %%p (output a void * in hex format) won't
 * work as expected at all, but that seems to be a fair trade-off
 * for the increased robustness of having printf-warnings work.
 *
 * Additionally, apr_vformatter allows for arbitrary output methods
 * using the apr_vformatter_buff and flush_func.
 *
 * The apr_vformatter_buff has two elements curpos and endpos.
 * curpos is where apr_vformatter will write the next byte of output.
 * It proceeds writing output to curpos, and updating curpos, until
 * either the end of output is reached, or curpos == endpos (i.e. the
 * buffer is full).
 *
 * If the end of output is reached, apr_vformatter returns the
 * number of bytes written.
 *
 * When the buffer is full, the flush_func is called.  The flush_func
 * can return -1 to indicate that no further output should be attempted,
 * and apr_vformatter will return immediately with -1.  Otherwise
 * the flush_func should flush the buffer in whatever manner is
 * appropriate, re apr_pool_t nitialize curpos and endpos, and return 0.
 *
 * Note that flush_func is only invoked as a result of attempting to
 * write another byte at curpos when curpos >= endpos.  So for
 * example, it's possible when the output exactly matches the buffer
 * space available that curpos == endpos will be true when
 * apr_vformatter returns.
 *
 * apr_vformatter does not call out to any other code, it is entirely
 * self-contained.  This allows the callers to do things which are
 * otherwise "unsafe".  For example, apr_psprintf uses the "scratch"
 * space at the unallocated end of a block, and doesn't actually
 * complete the allocation until apr_vformatter returns.  apr_psprintf
 * would be completely broken if apr_vformatter were to call anything
 * that used this same pool.  Similarly http_bprintf() uses the "scratch"
 * space at the end of its output buffer, and doesn't actually note
 * that the space is in use until it either has to flush the buffer
 * or until apr_vformatter returns.
 * </PRE>
