The 21st Century is a watershed time in human evolution.  This is the time when we are solving the mystery of how the brain works, and the beginning of the era of machine intelligence.

The book is written for engineers and scientists who want to build intelligent machines in either software or hardware.

The approach we take starts with the brain.  The way to build intelligent machines is to start with an understanding of what the human brain does and how it does it.  We need to understand the principles by which the brain works and only then should we attempt to build something in software or silicon.  We don’t have to emulate everything the brain does, but understanding the fundamental principles first is the way to go.

Classic A.I. attempted to build intelligent machines by encoding rules and knowledge in software.  A.I. has had many successes but those successes are limited in what they can do and for the most part A.I. is silent or weak on how machines can learn.  Despite its successes, A.I. has not made much progress towards general machine intelligence.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are learning systems which is an essential element of intelligence.  However, despite the word “neural” most ANNs don’t reflect what we find in brains.  Most “artificial neurons” are not like real neurons in essential ways, artificial neural networks are unlike networks we find in brains, and the way they are trained is often biologically impossible.  However, the bigger issue with most ANNs is that they exist outside of an overall theory about what brains do and how they work.  ANNs are typically used for classification of spatial patterns, such as images, which is a long way from an intelligent machine.

Large scale brain simulations such as “The Human Brain Project” strive to get the biology as accurate as possible but have little theoretical basis.  Without theory these simulations are unlikely to move us toward machine intelligence.

Instead, the approach we have taken is to study the neocortex to understand what it does and how it works.  The resultant theory starts with the overall structure of the neocortex and extends in scale down to the neuron and synapse.  But as you will see, once we understand the basic principles of neocortical operation we can deviate from biology and be confident we are not ignoring something essential.

This book is being written now because we have passed over a threshold.  We now know enough to build commercially valuable products based on brain principles and the field of machine intelligence is poised to make rapid progress.  From my perspective the most important new knowledge gained in the last few years is why the brain uses Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs) and how layers of cortical neurons work together to learn sequences and make predictions.  Another way to look at it is, until recently neuroscientists had detailed knowledge of how individual neurons work and a general idea how the overall neocortex works.  But there was a big gap in the middle.  We didn’t know how tens of thousands or millions of neurons work together as we typically see them in the neocortex.  The core of this book describes a theory that fills this gap, a theory we call the Cortical Learning Algorithm or CLA.

There are still many things we don’t understand about the brain and the neocortex.  In this book we will take care to point out the holes and inconsistencies.  There is nothing to be gained by glossing over these.  But that doesn’t take away from the progress we have made.  The claim I am making is we have made enough progress that the field can move forward much more rapidly than in the past.

This book, like the field of machine intelligence, is a living entity.  It is being made available for free with no copyright restrictions.  Anyone can translate it, suggest improvements, and redistribute without obligation.  I will continue to work on it and modify it as long as it makes sense.  I also invite contributions.  If you have made an advance, have a better way of explaining something, or can provide references please suggest them to me.
