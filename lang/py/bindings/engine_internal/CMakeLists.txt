## Begin generation of tools bindings for other programming languages
##
##########################################################################
# The typical build process for a set of bindings is as follows:
# 1) Run swig over a set of "interface" files with the target language
#    set appropriately. swig generates a file full of C wrapper functions
#    (e.g. swig_pyntha_tools.cpp for Python) plus a target language
#    file that loads the bindings and inserts proxy classes
#    (e.g. tools.py for Python).
# 2) Run the C++ compiler and linker over the C wrappers to generate a
#    library of wrappers. This library of wrappers depends on the
#    real C++ library it is wrapping (e.g. libtools.a).
#    The final C wrapper library must be linked dynamically, and must include
#    the real C++ library as well. The name of this dynamic library
#    and the flags used to link it depend heavily on the target language
#    and may differ by OS, CPU, etc. (e.g. _tools.so for Python).
# 3) Install the wrapper library (_tools.so) and the target language file
#    (tools.py) in an appropriate place in the install tree.
#    In Python, this is ROOT/lib/pythonM.m/site-packages/
#    However, to keep from polluting the global Python module namespace
#    with common names like 'tools', all numenta modules will
#    go into a package called nupic, so the final paths will be:
#      ROOT/lib/pythonM.m/site-packages/nupic/_tools.so
#      ROOT/lib/pythonM.m/site-packages/nupic/tools.py
