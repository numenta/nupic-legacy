"""
This module analyzes and estimates the distribution of averaged anomaly scores
from a given model. Given a new anomaly score ``s``, estimates
``P(score >= s)``.

The number ``P(score >= s)`` represents the likelihood of the current state of
predictability. For example, a likelihood of 0.01 or 1% means we see this much
predictability about one out of every 100 records. The number is not as unusual
as it seems. For records that arrive every minute, this means once every hour
and 40 minutes. A likelihood of 0.0001 or 0.01% means we see it once out of
10,000 records, or about once every 7 days.

USAGE
+++++

There are two ways to use the code: using the
:class:`.anomaly_likelihood.AnomalyLikelihood` helper class or using the raw
individual functions :func:`~.anomaly_likelihood.estimateAnomalyLikelihoods` and
:func:`~.anomaly_likelihood.updateAnomalyLikelihoods`.


Low-Level Function Usage
++++++++++++++++++++++++

There are two primary interface routines.

- :func:`~.anomaly_likelihood.estimateAnomalyLikelihoods`: batch routine, called
  initially and once in a while
- :func:`~.anomaly_likelihood.updateAnomalyLikelihoods`: online routine, called
  for every new data point

Initially:

.. code-block:: python

   likelihoods, avgRecordList, estimatorParams = \\
     estimateAnomalyLikelihoods(metric_data)

Whenever you get new data:

.. code-block:: python

   likelihoods, avgRecordList, estimatorParams = \\
     updateAnomalyLikelihoods(data2, estimatorParams)

And again (make sure you use the new estimatorParams returned in the above call
to updateAnomalyLikelihoods!).

.. code-block:: python

   likelihoods, avgRecordList, estimatorParams = \\
     updateAnomalyLikelihoods(data3, estimatorParams)

Every once in a while update estimator with a lot of recent data.

.. code-block:: python

   likelihoods, avgRecordList, estimatorParams = \\
     estimateAnomalyLikelihoods(lots_of_metric_data)


PARAMS
++++++

The parameters dict returned by the above functions has the following
structure. Note: the client does not need to know the details of this.
