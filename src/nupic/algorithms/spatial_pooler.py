class SpatialPooler(Serializable):
  """
  This class implements the spatial pooler. It is in charge of handling the
  relationships between the columns of a region and the inputs bits. The
  primary public interface to this function is the "compute" method, which
  takes in an input vector and returns a list of activeColumns columns.

  .. code-block:: python

     sp = SpatialPooler(...)
     for line in file:
       inputVector = numpy.array(line)
       sp.compute(inputVector)
       ...

  :param inputDimensions: (iter)
      A sequence representing the dimensions of the input vector. Format is
      (height, width, depth, ...), where each value represents the size of the
      dimension.  For a topology of one dimension with 100 inputs use 100, or
      (100,). For a two dimensional topology of 10x5 use (10,5). 
      Default ``(32, 32)``.
  
  :param columnDimensions: (iter)
      A sequence representing the dimensions of the columns in the region.
      Format is (height, width, depth, ...), where each value represents the
      size of the dimension.  For a topology of one dimension with 2000 columns
      use 2000, or (2000,). For a three dimensional topology of 32x64x16 use
      (32, 64, 16). Default ``(64, 64)``.
  
  :param potentialRadius: (int)
      This parameter determines the extent of the input that each column can
      potentially be connected to.  This can be thought of as the input bits
      that are visible to each column, or a 'receptiveField' of the field of
      vision. A large enough value will result in 'global coverage', meaning
      that each column can potentially be connected to every input bit. This
      parameter defines a square (or hyper
      square) area: a column will have a max square potential pool with sides of
      length 2 * potentialRadius + 1. Default ``16``.
  
  :param potentialPct: (float)
      The percent of the inputs, within a column's potential radius, that a
      column can be connected to.  If set to 1, the column will be connected
      to every input within its potential radius. This parameter is used to
      give each column a unique potential pool when a large potentialRadius
      causes overlap between the columns. At initialization time we choose
      ((2*potentialRadius + 1)^(# inputDimensions) * potentialPct) input bits
      to comprise the column's potential pool. Default ``0.5``.
  
  :param globalInhibition: (bool)
      If true, then during inhibition phase the winning columns are selected
      as the most active columns from the region as a whole. Otherwise, the
      winning columns are selected with respect to their local neighborhoods.
      Using global inhibition boosts performance x60. Default ``False``.

  :param localAreaDensity: (float)
      The desired density of active columns within a local inhibition area
      (the size of which is set by the internally calculated inhibitionRadius,
      which is in turn determined from the average size of the connected
      potential pools of all columns). The inhibition logic will insure that
      at most N columns remain ON within a local inhibition area, where
      N = localAreaDensity * (total number of columns in inhibition area). 
      Default ``-1.0``.
  
  :param numActiveColumnsPerInhArea: (float)
      An alternate way to control the density of the active columns. If
      numActiveColumnsPerInhArea is specified then localAreaDensity must be
      less than 0, and vice versa.  When using numActiveColumnsPerInhArea, the
      inhibition logic will insure that at most 'numActiveColumnsPerInhArea'
      columns remain ON within a local inhibition area (the size of which is
      set by the internally calculated inhibitionRadius, which is in turn
      determined from the average size of the connected receptive fields of all
      columns). When using this method, as columns learn and grow their
      effective receptive fields, the inhibitionRadius will grow, and hence the
      net density of the active columns will *decrease*. This is in contrast to
      the localAreaDensity method, which keeps the density of active columns
      the same regardless of the size of their receptive fields. Default ``10.0``.
  
  :param stimulusThreshold: (int)
      This is a number specifying the minimum number of synapses that must be
      on in order for a columns to turn ON. The purpose of this is to prevent
      noise input from activating columns. Specified as a percent of a fully
      grown synapse. Default ``0``.
  
  :param synPermInactiveDec: (float)
      The amount by which an inactive synapse is decremented in each round.
      Specified as a percent of a fully grown synapse. Default ``0.008``.
  
  :param synPermActiveInc: (float)
      The amount by which an active synapse is incremented in each round.
      Specified as a percent of a fully grown synapse. Default ``0.05``.
  
  :param synPermConnected: (float)
      The default connected threshold. Any synapse whose permanence value is
      above the connected threshold is a "connected synapse", meaning it can
      contribute to the cell's firing. Default ``0.1``.
  
  :param minPctOverlapDutyCycle: (float)
      A number between 0 and 1.0, used to set a floor on how often a column
      should have at least stimulusThreshold active inputs. Periodically, each
      column looks at the overlap duty cycle of all other columns within its
      inhibition radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable duty cycle
      to: minPctDutyCycleBeforeInh * max(other columns' duty cycles).  On each
      iteration, any column whose overlap duty cycle falls below this computed
      value will  get all of its permanence values boosted up by
      synPermActiveInc. Raising all permanences in response to a sub-par duty
      cycle before  inhibition allows a cell to search for new inputs when
      either its previously learned inputs are no longer ever active, or when
      the vast majority of them have been "hijacked" by other columns. Default 
      ``0.001``.

  :param dutyCyclePeriod: (int)
      The period used to calculate duty cycles. Higher values make it take
      longer to respond to changes in boost or synPerConnectedCell. Shorter
      values make it more unstable and likely to oscillate. Default ``1000``.

  :param boostStrength: (float)
      A number greater or equal than 0.0, used to control the strength of
      boosting. No boosting is applied if it is set to 0. Boosting strength
      increases as a function of boostStrength. Boosting encourages columns to
      have similar activeDutyCycles as their neighbors, which will lead to more
      efficient use of columns. However, too much boosting may also lead to
      instability of SP outputs. Default ``0.0``.

  :param seed: (int)
      Seed for our own pseudo-random number generator. Default ``-1``.

  :param spVerbosity: (int)
      spVerbosity level: 0, 1, 2, or 3. Default ``0``.

  :param wrapAround: (bool)
      Determines if inputs at the beginning and end of an input dimension should
      be considered neighbors when mapping columns to inputs. Default ``True``.
