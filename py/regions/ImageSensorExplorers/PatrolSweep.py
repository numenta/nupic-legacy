  This explorer generates multiple presentations for each image in a patrol-like
  path around the original image. For example, if the patrol radius is 2 then
  instead of the image being centered at (0,0) multiple presentations will be
  generated at the following offsets :


  (-2, -2) (-2, 0) (-2, 2)

  (-2, 0)    I     (2, 0)

  (-2, 2)  (0, 2)  (2, 2)


  PatrolSweep sub-classes SpiralSweep, which is provides general-purpose logic
  for explorers that generate multiple translated presentations of each image.
  It overrides the __init__ method where it generates the particular "patrol"
  list of offsets (where SpiralSweep generates a spiral-like list of offsets)
