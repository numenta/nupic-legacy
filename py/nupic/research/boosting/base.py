                          stimulusThreshold active inputs. Periodically, each

                          all other column within its inhibition radius and

                          to a sub-par duty cycle before  inhibition allows a
                          cell to search for new inputs when either its
                          previously learned inputs are no longer ever active,

                          cycle of all other columns within its inhibition
                          radius and sets its own internal minimal acceptable

                          its internal boost factor increased.
    dutyCyclePeriod:      The period used to calculate duty cycles. Higher
                          values make it take longer to respond to changes in
                          boost or synPerConnectedCell. Shorter values make it
                          more unstable and likely to oscillate.
    maxBoost:            The maximum overlap boost factor. Each column's
                          overlap gets multiplied by a boost factor
                          before it gets considered for inhibition.
                          The actual boost factor for a column is number
                          between 1.0 and maxBoost. A boost factor of 1.0 is
                          used if the duty cycle is >= minOverlapDutyCycle,
                          maxBoost is used if the duty cycle is 0, and any duty
                          cycle in between is linearly extrapolated from these
