  """ Database connection factory.

  WARNING: Minimize the scope of connection ownership to cover
    only the execution of SQL statements in order to avoid creating multiple
    outstanding SQL connections in gevent-based apps (e.g.,
    ProductionWorker) when polling code that calls timer.sleep()
    executes in the scope of an outstanding SQL connection, allowing a
    context switch to another greenlet that may also acquire an SQL connection.
    This is highly undesirable because SQL/RDS servers allow a limited number
    of connections. So, release connections before calling into any other code.
    Since connections are pooled by default, the overhead of calling
    ConnectionFactory.get() is insignificant.


  Usage Examples:

  # Add Context Manager (with ...) support for Jython/Python 2.5.x, if needed
  from __future__ import with_statement

  example1 (preferred):
      with ConnectionFactory.get() as conn:
        conn.cursor.execute("SELECT ...")

  example2 (if 'with' statement can't be used for some reason):
      conn = ConnectionFactory.get()
      try:
        conn.cursor.execute("SELECT ...")
      finally:
        conn.release()

    to the SQL server per nupic.cluster.database.* configuration settings.

    NOTE: caller is responsible for calling the ConnectionWrapper instance's
    release() method after using the connection in order to release resources.
    Better yet, use the returned ConnectionWrapper instance in a Context Manager
    statement for automatic invocation of release():
    Example:
        # If using Jython 2.5.x, first import with_statement at the very top of
        your script (don't need this import for Jython/Python 2.6.x and later):
        from __future__ import with_statement

        from nupic.database.Connection import ConnectionFactory
        # Then use it like this

          conn.cursor.execute("SELECT ...")
          conn.cursor.fetchall()
          conn.cursor.execute("INSERT ...")
