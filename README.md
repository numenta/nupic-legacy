### Run in production mode

The Installation guide contains instructions on how to download an init script and run it automatically on boot. You can also start the init script manually:

    sudo service gitlab start

or by directly calling the script

     sudo /etc/init.d/gitlab start

### Run in development mode

Start it with [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)

    bundle exec foreman start -p 3000

or start each component separately

    bundle exec rails s
    bundle exec rake sidekiq:start

### Run the tests

* Seed the database

        bundle exec rake db:setup RAILS_ENV=test
        bundle exec rake db:seed_fu RAILS_ENV=test

* Run all tests

        bundle exec rake gitlab:test

* [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) unit and functional tests

        bundle exec rake spec

* [Spinach](https://github.com/codegram/spinach) integration tests

Please search for similar issues before posting your own, there's a good chance somebody else had the same issue you have now and has resolved it. There are a lot of helpful GitLab users there who may be able to help you quickly. If your particular issue turns out to be a bug, it will find its way from there to a fix.

* [Feedback and suggestions forum](http://feedback.gitlab.com) is the place to propose and discuss new features for GitLab.
