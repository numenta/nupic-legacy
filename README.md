NuPIC is a library that provides the building blocks for online prediction and anomaly detection systems.  The library contains the [Cortical Learning Algorithm (CLA)](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Cortical-Learning-Algorithm), but also the [Online Prediction Framework (OPF)] (https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Online-Prediction-Framework) that allows clients to build prediction systems out of encoders, models, and metrics.

For more information, see [numenta.org](http://numenta.org) or the [NuPIC wiki](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki).

## Installation

For all installation options, see the [Installing and Building NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Installing-and-Building-NuPIC) wiki page.

### Currently supported platforms:

 * Linux (64bit)
 * Mac OSX
 * Raspberry Pi (ARMv6)
 * Chromebook (Ubuntu ARM, Crouton) (ARMv7)
 * [VM images](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Running-Nupic-in-a-Virtual-Machine)

### Dependencies:

 * Python (2.6-2.7) (with development headers)
 * GCC (4.6-4.8), or Clang
 * Make or any IDE supported by CMake (Visual Studio, Eclipse, XCode, KDevelop, etc)

The dependencies are included in platform-specific repositories for convenience. Installing from these repositories is not required if the dependencies defined above have been manually installed or already exist on your system.

* [nupic-linux64](https://github.com/numenta/nupic-linux64) for 64-bit Linux systems
* [nupic-darwin64](https://github.com/numenta/nupic-darwin64) for 64-bit OS X systems

Complete set of python requirements are documented in [requirements.txt](/external/common/requirements.txt),
compatible with [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/cookbook.html#requirements-files):

### Installing Python Dependencies

    pip install -r external/common/requirements.txt

> _Note_: If using pip 1.5 or later:

    pip install --allow-all-external --allow-unverified PIL --allow-unverified psutil -r external/common/requirements.txt

> _Note_: If you get a "permission denied" error when using pip, you may add the `--user` flag to install to a location in your home directory, which should resolve any permissions issues. Doing this, you may need to add this location to your PATH and PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, you can run pip with `sudo`.

### Installing NuPIC

Move into the NuPIC installation directory and run:

    python setup.py install

> _Note_: If you get a "permission denied" error when using this, you may add the `--user` flag to install to a location in your home directory, which should resolve any permissions issues. Doing this, you may need to add this location to your PATH and PYTHONPATH. Alternatively, you can run this with `sudo`.

Once it is installed, you can import NuPIC library to your python script using:

    import nupic

For examples, tutorials, and screencasts about using NuPIC, see the [Using NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Using-NuPIC) wiki page.

## Developer instructions

If you want to develop, debug, or simply test NuPIC, clone it and follow the instructions:

### Using command line

> This assumes the `NUPIC` environment variable is set to the directory where the NuPIC source code exists.

    cd $NUPIC
    python setup.py build
    python setup.py develop

#### To run the tests:

    cd $NUPIC/build/scripts
    # Python HTM Network API tests
    make tests_pyhtm
    # Python OPF unit tests
    make python_unit_tests
    # Python OPF integration tests
    make python_integration_tests
    # Python OPF swarming tests (requires mysql)
    make python_swarming_tests
    # Run all tests!
    make tests_all

### Using an IDE

See our [Development Tips](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Development-Tips) wiki page for details.

#### To run the tests:

 * Run any [test](#run-the-tests) project from your IDE (check `output` panel to see the results).
