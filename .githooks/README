To use these git hooks, ln the githooks directory into the appropriate repo.
For example, adding the hooks to trunk located at ~/nta/trunk, use the
following (must use absolute paths):
  ln -s ~/nta/trunk/githooks ~/nta/trunk/.git/hooks

The pre-commit file is executed before each commit and the commit fails if it
returns a non-zero exit code.  This can be overridden by committing files as
follows:
  git commit --no-verify ...
