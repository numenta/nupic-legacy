Temporal Pooler Sample Code
=====

This directory contains a number of files that demonstrate how to use the
temporal pooler directly. They are currently implemented as tests that
test (and illustrate) various interesting properties of the temporal pooler.

Most of the files explain the tests at the beginning. You can run each one
by invoking python on the file, as in "python tp_test.py"


WARNING: understanding these files requires building up a very detailed
knowledge of how the temporal pooler works in CLA's. The documentation is not
great at this level of detail - any suggestions or help appreciated!
