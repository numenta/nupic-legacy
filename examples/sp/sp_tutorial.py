A simple tutorial that shows some features of the Spatial Pooler.

The following program has the purpose of presenting some
basic properties of the Spatial Pooler. It reproduces Figs.
5, 7 and 9 from this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02142
To learn more about the Spatial Pooler have a look at BAMI:
http://numenta.com/biological-and-machine-intelligence/
or at its class reference in the NuPIC documentation:
http://numenta.org/docs/nupic/classnupic_1_1research_1_1spatial__pooler_1_1_spatial_pooler.html
The purpose of the Spatial Pooler is to create a sparse representation
of its inputs in such a way that similar inputs will be mapped to similar
sparse representations. Thus, the Spatial Pooler should exhibit some resilience
to noise in its input.

# will select a small percentage (usually 2%) of its most active columns,
# ie. columns with the largest overlap score.

# of the Spatial Pooler (SP) after feeding it with a random binary

# that are chosen to build the sparse representation of the input.
