# OPF Client Examples

This directory contains examples of custom OPF clients. For more information on how to write a client, see the [OPF wiki page](https://github.com/numenta/nupic/wiki/Online-Prediction-Framework).

## Clients

* __hotgym__ - This is a custom client that performs the same experiment as `examples/opf/experiments/multistep/hotgym/`.
* __hotgym_anomaly__ - This is a custom client that performs the same experiment as `examples/opf/experiments/anomaly/temporal/hotgym`.
* __cpu__ - This is a custom client that attempts to predict CPU usage. The actual and predicted values are plotted live.
