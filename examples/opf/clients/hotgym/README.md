# The "Hot Gym"

> A NuPIC Tutorial, in several parts.

**This is a work in progress**

## Premise

The "hot gym" sample application has been around for a long time, and was one of the first real-world applications of NuPIC that actually worked. The data used is real energy consumption data from a gym in Australia, which simply contains a timestamp and float value for energy consumption.

This collection of tutorials uses the "Hot Gym" premise to illustrate many ways users can set up and run a NuPIC application against real-world data.
